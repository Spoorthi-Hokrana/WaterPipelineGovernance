- [ ] Production build succeeds: `npm run build`

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Steps**

### Method 1: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Connect to Vercel
# Visit: https://vercel.com/new
# Import your GitHub repository
# Framework will be auto-detected as Next.js

# 3. Add Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
# Go to: Settings â†’ Environment Variables
# Add all variables from your .env.local file

# 4. Deploy
# Deployment will start automatically
```

### Method 2: Direct CLI Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login to Vercel
vercel login

# 3. Set Environment Variables
npm run setup:env  # Follow the prompts
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID

# 4. Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## ðŸ§ª **Post-Deployment Testing**

### 1. **Automated Testing**
```bash
# Test your deployment (replace with your actual URL)
npm run test:deployment https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### 2. **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Health check passes: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
- [ ] Wallet connection works
- [ ] Correct network detected (Moonbase Alpha)
- [ ] All pages accessible and responsive
- [ ] Contract data loads (admin address, proposal count)

### 3. **Functional Testing**
- [ ] Connect wallet to Moonbase Alpha
- [ ] Admin features work (if you're admin)
- [ ] Navigation works on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Loading states and notifications work
- [ ] Error handling works (try wrong network)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

Your deployment is successful when:

âœ… **Health Check**: Returns `"status": "healthy"`  
âœ… **Environment**: All variables show `true` in health response  
âœ… **Connectivity**: All critical pages load (/, /proposals, /voting, /milestones, /admin)  
âœ… **Web3**: Wallet connects and detects Moonbase Alpha  
âœ… **Contract**: Admin address and proposal count load correctly  
âœ… **Performance**: Page load time < 3 seconds  
âœ… **Security**: Security headers present  
âœ… **Mobile**: Responsive design works on mobile devices  

## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"Environment variables missing"**
```bash
# Solution: Add missing variables in Vercel dashboard
vercel env ls  # Check current variables
# Add missing ones via dashboard or CLI
```

### **"Contract not found"** 
```bash
# Solution: Verify contract address and network
# 1. Check contract exists on Moonbase Alpha
# 2. Verify address format (0x + 40 hex chars)
# 3. Confirm network ID is 1287
```

### **"Build failed"**
```bash
# Solution: Check build logs and fix issues
vercel logs  # View deployment logs
npm run validate  # Check locally
npm run build  # Test build locally
```

### **"Wallet connection fails"**
```bash
# Solution: Check Web3 configuration
# 1. Ensure site is on HTTPS
# 2. Check Thirdweb client ID is correct
# 3. Verify MetaMask has Moonbase Alpha network
```

## ðŸ“Š **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Setup and validation
npm run setup:env          # Interactive environment setup
npm run validate            # Check build requirements
npm run build              # Test production build

# Deployment
npm run deploy:preview     # Deploy preview version
npm run deploy             # Deploy to production
npm run test:deployment    # Test live deployment

# Vercel management
vercel env ls              # List environment variables
vercel logs               # View deployment logs
vercel --force            # Force redeploy
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **You're Ready!**

Once all checklist items are complete:

1. Your Water Pipeline Governance platform will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`
2. Users can connect wallets and interact with your smart contract
3. The platform is optimized for performance and security
4. You have full monitoring and testing capabilities

## ðŸ“ž **Need Help?**
